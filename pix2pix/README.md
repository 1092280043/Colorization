# pix2pix  
## Summary
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004 "here")  
- The authors of pix2pix use UNet as generator.
- They calculate not only mean absolute error but also adversarial loss which is gotten by distinguishing whether the input image is real or fake.

## Dataset
- I collected 10000 illustrations from safebooru.
- After resizing 128×128 properly, I randomly cropped 64×64 from these images.
- Finally, I extracted the line art with opencv from these cropped images.

## Usage
Execute the command line after preparing `.npy` file contained with line arts and colored images.
```bash
$ python colorization.py
```

## Result
Result generated by my development environment is below.

- Batch size: 10
