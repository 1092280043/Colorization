![](https://github.com/SerialLain3170/Colorization/blob/master/reference_adain/data/generator.png)

- Preparing reference images, this model aims to colorize like reference image with Adaptive Instance Normalization.
- It is better to start training the untrained reference encoder than trained.

## Usage

### Traning Phase
Execute the command line below.

```bash
$ python train.py --data_path <DATA_PATH> --sketch_path <SKETCH_PATH>
```
`DATA_PATH`: Path which contains color images
`SKETCH_PATH`: Path which contains lines obtained by SketchKeras

## Result
Image generated by my development environment is below.
