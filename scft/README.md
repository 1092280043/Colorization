# Augmented-Self Reference and Dense Semantic Correspondence

## Summary
![](https://github.com/SerialLain3170/Colorization/blob/master/scft/data/concept.png)

- Authors give sptially transformed images as reference images and color augmented images as target images

## Result
- Results generated by my environment are below (`AdaIN` corresponds to my implementation in `../style2paints` and `SCFT` are from this implementation).

- While `AdaIN` sprays, `SCFT` is able to colorize by recognizing correspondences between reference images and line arts)
