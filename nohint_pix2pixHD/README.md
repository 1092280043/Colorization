# pix2pixHD

## Summary
![net](https://github.com/SerialLain3170/Line-to-Color/blob/master/pix2pixHD/network.png)

- This model is the update version of pix2pix.
- The authors of this paper can generate high-resolution images by proposing coarse-to-fine generator and multi-scale discriminator.

## Usage
Execute the command line below and you can pre-train glbal generator.
```py
$ python pretrain.py
```

Execute the command line below and you can train full architectures contained with local enhancer.
```py
$ python train.py
```

## Result
Images generated by my development environment is below.
![result](https://github.com/SerialLain3170/Line-to-Color/blob/master/nohint_pix2pixHD/visualize_125.png)

- Batch size: 4
- Using Adam as optimizer
- The weight of adversarial loss is 10.0
- I think this code is not completed because no method which enables global generator to pre-train is described in this paper
