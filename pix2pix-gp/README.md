# pix2pix + wasserstein metrics

## Summary
![net](https://github.com/SerialLain3170/Colorization/blob/master/pix2pix-gp/net.png)
- I constructed the architecture of generator based on UNet and use Residual blocks in mid-hidden layers.
- I use nearest neighbor upsampling -> convolution as upsampling method.
- In addition to content loss and adversarial loss, I use zero-centered gradient penalty.

## Usage
Execute command line after containing line arts in `line_path` and colored images in `color_path`.
```py
$ python train.py
```

## Result
Result generated by my development environment is below.

- Batch size: 3
- The weight of gradient penalty is 10.0 and the weight of content loss is 10.0
- Using Adam as optimizer
