# pix2pix  
## Summary
- The authors of pix2pix use UNet as generator.
- They calculate not only mean absolute error but also adversarial loss which is gotten by distinguishing whether the input image is real or fake.
- In addition to content loss and adversarial loss, gradient penalty can be chosen.

## Usage
Execute the command line below.

```bash
$ python train.py --data_path <DATA_PATH> --sketch_path <SKETCH_PATH>
```
`DATA_PATH`: Path containing colorized images.  
`SKETCH_PATH`: Path containing line arts obtained by SketchKeras
