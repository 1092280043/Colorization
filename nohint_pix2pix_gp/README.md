# pix2pix-gp

## Summary
![net](https://github.com/SerialLain3170/Colorization/blob/master/nohint_pix2pix_gp/net.png)
- I constructed the architecture of generator based on UNet and use Residual blocks in mid-hidden layers.
- I use nearest neighbor upsampling -> convolution as upsampling method.
- In addition to content loss and adversarial loss, I use zero-centered gradient penalty.

## Usage
Execute the command line below.

```bash
$ python train.py --data_path <DATA_PATH> --sketch_path <SKETCH_PATH> --digi_path <DIGI_PATH>
```
`DATA_PATH`: Path containing colorized images.  
`SKETCH_PATH`: Path containing line arts obtained by SketchKeras  
`DIGI_PATH`: Path containing line arts obtained by Sketch Simplification

## Result
Result generated by my development environment is below.

- Batch size: 3
- The weight of gradient penalty is 10.0 and the weight of content loss is 10.0
- Using Adam as optimizer
